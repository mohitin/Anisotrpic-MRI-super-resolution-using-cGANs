# Anisotrpic-MRI-super-resolution-using-cGANs
This repo contains the course project for Medical Image Computing (CS736) at IIT Bombay.\
**Problem Description:**
- Capturing high resolution MRI images is time taking process and sometimes not suitable for medical emergencies. 
- High resolution images requires huge amount of memory to store.
- Low resolution imaging is faster but it compromises with fine details that might be helpful in diagnosis of a diseases.
- So we need a way that ensures good quality images in less amount of time.
- Super resolution aimed to reconstruct detailed High resolution (HR) images from low resolution images.
- Interpolation method fails to recover high frequency information like edges.
- Non learning method has an limitation that they require sound prior knowledge about the data representation.
- Learning based methods learns directly from the set of images provided. Hence no prior information required.
